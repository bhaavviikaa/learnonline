        #Python Notes

    <section class="section">

        <div class="note_py">
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van
                Rossum, and released in 1991.

                It is used for:

                web development (server-side),
                software development,
                mathematics,
                system scripting.
                What can Python do?
                Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
                Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
                Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
                Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.
                Why Python?
                Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
                Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
                languages.
                Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This
                means that prototyping can be very quick.
                Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
                Good to know
                The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However,
                Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
                In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an
                Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly
                useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</p>

        #Javascript Notes
    </h2>
    <section class="section">

        <div class="note_py">
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
                JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
                Our JavaScript Tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals both. JavaScript is used to create
                client-side dynamic pages.

                JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

                JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator
                (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.

                What is JavaScript
                JavaScript (js) is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites
                for scripting the webpages. It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic
                interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document. It was introduced in the year 1995 for
                adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser. Since then, it has been adopted by
                all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact
                directly without reloading the page every time. The traditional website uses js to provide several forms
                of interactivity and simplicity.

                Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language. The name was suggested and
                provided in the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market. In addition to web browsers,
                databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query language.

                Features of JavaScript
                There are following features of JavaScript:

                All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.
                JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured
                programming language.
                JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the
                operation).
                JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for
                inheritance.
                It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.
                It is a case-sensitive language.
                JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
                It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
                
                JavaScript is easy to learn.

                This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advanced.

        #React Js Notes
    </h2>
    <section class="section">

        <div class="note_py">
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> React is officially defined as a "JavaScript library for creating user interfaces," but what does that really mean?

                React is a library, made in JavaScript and which we code in JavaScript, to build great applications that run on the web.
                
                What do I need to know to learn React?
                In other words, you do need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript to become a solid React programmer?
                
                The most basic JavaScript concepts you should be familiar with are variables, basic data types, conditionals, array methods, functions, and ES modules.
                
                How do I learn all of these JavaScript skills? Check out the comprehensive guide to learn all of the JavaScript you need for React.
                
                If React was made in JavaScript, why don't we just use JavaScript?
                React was written in JavaScript, which was built from the ground up for the express purpose of building web applications and gives us tools to do so.
                
                JavaScript is a 20+ year old language which was created for adding small bits of behavior to the browser through scripts and was not designed for creating complete applications.
                
                In other words, while JavaScript was used to create React, they were created for very different purposes.
                
                Can I use JavaScript in React applications?
                Yes! You can include any valid JavaScript code within your React applications.
                
                You can use any browser or window API, such as geolocation or the fetch API.
                
                Also, since React (when it is compiled) runs in the browser, you can perform common JavaScript actions like DOM querying and manipulation.
